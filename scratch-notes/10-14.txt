    Clock page replacement - circular linked list of pages
        - page fault occurs, page the hand is pointing to is inspected
            - action depends on R bit (R = 0 - EVICT page and load new page, R = 1 - clear R and advance hand)
    

    Last Recently Used algorithm
        - approximation of the optimal algorithm
            - pages that have not b een used for ages will likely remain that way
            - when page fault occurs, throw out page that has been unused for the longest

        - implementation
            - record time or use linked list for all pages in memory
            - hardware counter or a matrix

            - hard to implement efficiently
        
        - sometimes simulated with software (NFU)

    Not Frequently Used 
        - record referenced times of pages
        - when page fault, lowest page is evicted
    
    Working Set Page replacement
        - load pages on demand, not in advance
        - processes reference a small fraction of their pages
