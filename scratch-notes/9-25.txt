    void* file_in_memory = mmap(.....); // void pointer points at the beginning of some unknown thing, cannot be dereferenced
                                        // can increment and goes to next byte (in *most* machines)
        // makes a pointer to beginning of file mapped in memory
        // file organized in blocks that contain 32 bytes (each prefix followed by name followed by padding)
        // so we should use an array of blocks of 32 bytes

        char prefix[6];
        char location[25];

    // now we can use this new struct to grab things
    entry_t* data_array = (entry_t *) file_in_memory; // cast this into our new struct
    entry_t data_array[] = (entry_t*) file_in_memory; // same thing as above, different form

    data_array[0].prefix // access to the 0th element

    // now we can have a method that compares the prefixes for sorting

Exam is open textbook + reference card (letter sized)
Printout of any man page you wish (or if you're in airplane mode - can use that for manpages)
Chapters 1 & 2
    How does a system call work
    How does interprocess communication work? Two processes, how to send information to each other
    How to implement semaphores with hardware support (test and set lock + other solution)
    Ugly interface, beautiful interface offered by operating system - use OS to implement features not in instruction set

Scheduling in Batch Systems - Methods
    First Come, First Served
        disadvantages -
            long jobs block short jobs due to poor timing
            even if short jobs need tiny amounts of processing time, they still are slowed by other processes ahead
    Shortest Task First
        provably optimal for turnaround times
            when all jobs are available simultaneously
            and time needed is known
    
Scheduling in Interactive Systems
    Round-robin
        handle each process in turn for a max time before moving on to the next, continue until processe are complete
        higher average turnaround than shortest first, but better response (make progress on each process regularly)
        time parameter is called quantum - this value is important
            quantum too big = first come first serve
            too small = context switches, high overhead, low CPU util
                penalty depends on how long the context switch takes
                    quantum 4 msec but context switch of 1 msec, 20% CPU wasted
            however, should be small enough to maintain interactive nature of the system for user
    Priority Scheduling
        handled processes according to priority
    Multiple Queues
        different queues for CPU-bound processes and interactive processes
        not good for processes that can be either CPU-bound and later interactive
    Shortest Process next
        similar to shortest task first in batch systems (mostly theoretical)
    Guaranteed Scheduling
    Lottery Scheduling
    Fair-share Scheduling
