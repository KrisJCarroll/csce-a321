Exam Review Questions

    Implementing features in the OS that are no longer supported by the instruction set - what does this mean?
        Example dividing by 0 - a hardware interrupt is mimicked, the operating system is run in kernel mode,
            simulate registers that can handle the instruction that no longer exists
            pop into kernel mode to force the CPU to calculate the simulated registers
            come back to user mode and have access to the data necessary for the instruction to have been performed

    Why do we say the syscall interface abstracts the hardware?
        Lots of different systems, 32-bit, 64-bit, ARM, Raspberry Pi
        Network card in 32-bit has access to a pin on the processor that allows for an interrupt
        However on Raspberry Pi, the network card is attached to a USB hub which is then connected to the 
	processor
            However, this is still approached the same way from our point of view, thus the interface is abstracting
            away how the hardware actually performs when the syscalls are made.
        
    Creation/termination
        In Linux, handled by forking and typically allow processes to terminate themselves
            - kill sends signal to process which unless specified to say something else, suggests the process should die
            - however, this type of signal can also communicate other things such as whether or not to take user input again
        in Windows, killing the process will actually forcefully terminate the process

                      file

    How do you prevent race conditions?
        Determine shared memory locations and use mutexes to control access to critical sections

Homework grades got boosted because it's taking so long!
    Homework is generally not going to be any of the same material focused on as the exams


Chapter 3 - Memory Management

    Looking at malloc, calloc insides - very ugly but the hardware is even uglier
    Homework 3 will be to implement malloc, calloc, and free with system 2 calls
        mmap a file, if the file is empty, this is free memory that can be used to allocate and deallocate memory

    Before memory abstraction, careful monitoring of physical address space needed to be undertaken for 
        programs to run concurrently.
    
    Early abstraction allowed for storing a base and limit register for each program
        then when the program references a memory location, it would add base to the location mentioned
        if value was higher than limit register, trap and allow OS to handle the violation accordingly

    Now, there are tons of background processes that are running on a system, not enough memory to hold them all at once
        now have to swap them in and out as needed
        create virtual memory
