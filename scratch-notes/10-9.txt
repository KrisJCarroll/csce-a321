Speeding up paging cont.

    To deal with large page tables, use translation lookaside buffers
        slightly slower than registers but extremely fast compared to memory
        this exists actually on the CPU die

    Page replacement algorithms
    
        Optimal page replacement algorithm - mostly theory since it requires an oracle

        Not recently used
            replaces pages based on usage
            R (read) and M (modified) bit - originally set to 0. R bit is cleared periodically
                4 Classes, combinations of reference and modified
                    0: not R, not M
                    1: not R, M
                    2: R, not M
                    3: R, M
                Lowest class used for decision making

        FIFO
            replace the oldest page
            super crap algo
        
        2nd Chance
            Making FIFO less crap by stopping heavily used pages from being thrown out

        
        

    Review paging and page faults and crap
